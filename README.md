### SUSSED Mockup

This mockup is designed to show what students want from SUSSED. It prioritises the information we need to see and access to tools we need on a regular basis.

The mockup aims to exclude anything which is unnecessary for students to make an easier to use site that will encourage students to use it more.

### Contribution

Fork this, make changes, submit pull requests as usual, but try and stick to the following guidelines:

 - This is static only, and should remain so.
 - Any new pages you integrate, make sure they are accessible from the index page, link in the way they would be linked properly, or in the footer if you have to.
 - Stick to the current design, use Twitter Bootstrap where you can because its awesome and makes a consistent UI.

### University Staff / iSolutions

 - You wanted our feedback, this is it. This is what we would use.
 - We did this as quickly as possible. There are flaws, and the UI needs to be customised to fit UoS branding, but essentially, this is it.
